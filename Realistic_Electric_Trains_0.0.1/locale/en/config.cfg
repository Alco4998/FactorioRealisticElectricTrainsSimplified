ret-pole-base=Overhead line pole base
ret-signal-pole-base=Overhead line pole base with signal
ret-chain-pole-base=Overhead line pole base with chain signal
ret-pole-placer=Overhead line pole
ret-signal-pole-placer=Overhead line pole with signal
ret-chain-pole-placer=Overhead line pole with chain signal

ret-pole-wire=Overhead line wire
ret-pole-energy=Overhead line power consumer
ret-pole-holder-straight=Overhead line wire holder
ret-pole-holder-diagonal=Overhead line wire holder

ret-electric-locomotive=Electric Locomotive

[item-name]
ret-pole-debugger=Overhead line debugger

[technology-name]
ret-electric-locomotives=Electric Locomotives

[technology-description]
ret-electric-locomotives=Locomotives that require electricity instead of fuel.

[message]
ret-connect-failure=Cannot connect overhead line
ret-connect-failure-curve=Curve requires closer poles
ret-connect-failure-distance=__1__ tile(s) too far away

[mod-setting-name]
ret-enable-connect-particles=Enable connection particles
ret-enable-failure-text=Enable connection failure text
ret-max-pole-search-distance=Maximum additional search distance
ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=Enable rewiring of neighbours

[mod-setting-description]
ret-enable-connect-particles=If enabled, red and green particles will show if rails become powered or unpowered.
ret-enable-failure-text=If enabled, a message text will pop up if two overhead line poles could not be connected.
ret-max-pole-search-distance=The additional distance checked when searching for overhead line poles. A higher value gives more accurate distances in the failure message. A lower value might increase performance during building.
ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=If enabled, neighbours of newly placed poles will be rewired. This fixes some weird wiring patterns, but takes more processing time.
