Realistic Electric Trains
=========================

Realistic Electric Trains - or RET for short - adds locomotives to Factorio that
are powered with electricity from overhead lines, rather than fuel.

Link to the Factorio Mod Portal will be added soon

Currently, a basic electric locomotive and overhead line poles with and without 
integrated signals are implemented. I'm planning on adding higher-tier 
locomotives and better 3D models in the near future.

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute, feel free to do so via a git pull request. Please
test your code and try to document it. If you want to submit graphics or better
3D models, you can do so too. For 3D models I need the exact camera and
animation setup in order to have the images rendered pixel-perfectly.

Please note though, that I obviously cannot accept any random change. If you
want to know whether I like an idea of yours, just ask in the mod portal.
